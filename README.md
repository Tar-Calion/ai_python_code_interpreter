# AI Python Code Interpreter
This project provides a Python-based solution for interpreting and executing Python code blocks that were generated by Gemini Pro LLM. It is designed to facilitate the process of solving coding challenges, specifically those from the Advent of Code series.

## Features
- Extracts Python code blocks from Markdown text using the CodeExtractor class.
- Executes extracted Python code using the PythonCodeExecutor class.
- Captures standard output, standard error, and exceptions from executed code.
- Extracts the line of code that caused an exception.
- Provides a chat loop interface for interactive code execution and debugging.
- Includes a client for the Gemini Pro model, which can be used to generate code based on a given prompt.

## Usage
The main entry point for the project is the advent_of_code_solver.py script. This script prompts the user for a project name, creates a directory for the project, and reads the puzzle and input data from text files in the project directory. It then starts a chat loop, which guides the user through the process of solving the puzzle.

You need to log in to Google Cloud to use the Gemini Pro model. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

## Known Issues
- The LLM may stuck in a loop and return the same output over and over again.
- The LLM may lie and give a halucinated solution.
- Gemini Pro is not very good at following instructions and coding.

## Further Development
- Save the chat history and the generated code files in project directories
- Support different LLM clients
- Reduce chat context when it is getting too long
- Modus with auto-confirmation
- Produce multiple solutions and compare them
- Detect an infinite loop and reset the chat
- Handle invalid responses (nether code nor answer)
- Double-check the answer with a smarter model
